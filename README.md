To enhance my contribution on learning Data Structure

# Types of DataStructure 
    1. Linear DataStructure
    2. Non-Linear DataStructure

# 1.Linear DataStructure 
    i. Static DataStructure
    ii. Dynamic DataStructure

# i. Static DataStructure
    Array Implementation
    
# ii. Dynamic DataStructure
    1. Linked List
    2. Stack
    3. Queue

# 2.Non-Linear DataStructure
    1. Tree
    2. Graph

# Mapping with Real-Time Example 
    Array - Arranging books on the table.
    LinkedList - planets in a space.
    Stack - Arranging coins vertically.
    Queue - Ticket Reservation.
    Tree - cloud Architecture, City and House.
    Graph - BlockChain, Networking.
